# 7. Expose CICS Application data through z/OS Connect

* ## IPIC Connection Configuration

  - Define a TCPIPService to listen for inbound IPIC requests in your CICS region. This scenario uses a port value of 1091. For more information about defining a TCPIPService for inbound IPIC requests, see [Configuring the IPIC connection](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGMCP_5.4.0/applications/developing/java/dfhpj2_jca_remote_eci_ipicconfig.html) in the _CICS Transaction Server_ documentation. 

  - The following artifacts are needed:

    - A server.xml configuration file with the zosconnect:cicsService-1.0 feature included.

  - Customize the z/OS Connect EE server configuration file.

    - Update the CICS connection element: \<zosconnect_cicsIpicConnection id="yourConnName" host="localhost" port="1234"/>

      - If your server and CICS region are on different LPARs, replace the host value localhost with the host name or IP address of the LPAR hosting your CICS region.

      - Replace the port value 1234 with the port that your CICS TCPIPService is configured to listen for inbound IPIC requests. This scenario uses port 1091.

    - Update the httpPort for inbound connections into z/OS Connect EE in the following element, if necessary: <br/>
      \<httpEndpoint id="defaultHttpEndpoint" host="\*" httpPort="9080" httpsPort="-1"/>

    - Enable security if required.
    
   - Additional instruction may also be found in the CICS RESTful APIs section of the [Getting Started Guide](https://www-03.ibm.com/support/techdocs/atsmastr.nsf/WebIndex/WP102724)

    <br/>![Service Project Popup](doc/source/images/newserviceproj2.png) <br/> 

    - Select **CICS COMMAREA Service** for the project type.

  - Click **Finish** to create the project. <br/> The service project is created in the Project Explorer view. The service.properties file opens in the service project editor in a tab that is named after the service project. This service project editor is where you can configure the service and define the service interface. Initially, errors (![Error Red X](doc/source/images/ErrorRedX.png)) are reported and highlighted for information that is required and must be specified. Depending on the service type, required information varies. <br/> _The service project editor_  <br/>![Service Project Editor](doc/source/images/servicemain.png) <br/> The **Actions** pane highlights the steps to create a service.

  - In the service project editor, take the following steps:

    - Optionally, change the version number from the default of 1.0.0.

    - Specify the program for CICS.

    - Define the request and response service interfaces. The service interfaces are defined by importing COBOL copybooks,PL/I include files, or full programs and customizing the interfaces. For more information, see [Defining the request and response service interfaces](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4SVW_3.0.0/designing/service_compose_interface.html?view=kc).

    - Create/Select the service interface file to use for the **Request service interface** field.

    - Create/select the service interface file to use for the **Response service interface** field.
    
     - Optionally, specify initialization, conversion, and omission options for your data by clicking **Advanced Options**. <br/> For more information, see [Service-level data conversion customization](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4SVW_3.0.0/designing/service_advancedmapping.html?view=kc).

    - Click the **Configuration** tab to configure subsystem-specific service properties. For more information see [Configuring service properties](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4SVW_3.0.0/designing/service_specify_properties.html?view=kc).

    - Save your changes.
    
    <br/>![Service Configuration](doc/source/images/serviceconfiguration.PNG) <br/> 

    - After validation that all required information is specified, the JSON schema files and the service XML file are created in the service project folder. 

- ## Deploy the CICS service using the API toolkit

  - In the Project Explorer view, right-click the service project and select **z/OS Connect EE > Deploy Service to z/OS Connect EE Server**. 

  <br/>![Service Deploy](doc/source/images/deployservice.png) <br/> 

- ## Test the CICS HCAZ service

  - Start CICSÂ® and ensure that the TCPIPService is open.

  - Make sure your service is started. For more information, see [Starting and stopping z/OS Connect EE](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4SVW_3.0.0/operating/start_stop_server.html?view=kc).

    - Check the messages.log file for the following messages that confirm that the services are installed.

      - `BAQR7043I: z/OS Connect EE service archive yourServiceName installed successfully.`
 
  - Use the REST client tool of your choice to test the url associated with your service
    Use the HTTP POST to invoke the service
      
      `https://yourhostname:port/zosConnect/services/yourServiceName?action=invoke`
      
    You will need to send the request as json body
    
    `Example body:`
    <br/>`{` <br/>
    <br/> `"programName" : {`<br/>
    <br/>    `"serviceName": {`<br/>
    <br/>     ` "fieldName": "value"`<br/>
    <br/>      `}`<br/>
    <br/>    `}`<br/>
    <br/> `}`<br/>
     
     If you get the correct data in your response, your service works.

    - You have verified that your newly created inquireSingle service works CICS.
