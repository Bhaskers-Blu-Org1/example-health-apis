# z/OS Connect & API Connect Code Pattern for Summit Health

This code pattern shows you how to expose data from a DB2 database and a CICS application through z/OS Connect and then create APIs to access that data with API Connect.

This work was done as part of the Summit Health set of code patterns, which demonstrate how cloud technology can access data stored on z/OS Systems. We needed a way to access the large amounts of data stored on a DB2 database and a CICS application. We used z/OS Connect and API Connect to expose the data through REST APIs. z/OS Connect provides a single, common way to unleash your existing market-differentiating assets on IBM with RESTful APIs. API Connect allows automated API creation, simple discovery of assets, self-service access for developers, and built-in security and governance. z/OS Connect was used first to expose the data from DB2 and CICS as REST APIs. Then API Connect was used to create a way for developers to easily access the APIs through an intuitive portal.

This code pattern is for people with an intermediate understanding and experience working with Z Systems, z/OS and Eclipse tools like IBM Explorer for z/OS.

When the reader has completed this code pattern, they will understand how to:

- Use z/OS Connect to expose CICS and DB2 Data with REST APIs
- Use API Connect to manage your APIs and create a portal for developers to access them

### Pre-requisites

- In order to create a DB2 RESTful service, the system pre-requisite is to have DB2 v11 or v12 with associated PTFs for REST API support. (Info on APARs here:<br/> http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1II14827 )

- The Service and API Creator will need the z/OS Connect API Toolkit for service (.sar) file generation of CICS services and API (.aar) file generation for CICS and DB2 APIs.

- The API Creator will also need to have some sort of REST client tool. That can be in the form of a browser plug-in (such as Rest Client for Firefox or Advanced Rest Client for Chrome) or a desktop tool such as Postman or CuRL.

- The **z/OS Connect Build Toolkit** will be needed for the .sar file generation for Db2 services. This tool can be run either on the mainframe (omvs) or in a Windows command interface. These instructions do so on Windows. <br/> The build toolkit is packaged as a zip file and cab be obtained here: <br/> https://developer.ibm.com/mainframe/zos-connect-ee-build-toolkit/

## Flow

This is how your APIs will be routed from your backend systems to a developer friendly portal.

1. z/OS Connect exposes the DB2 data through REST APIs
2. z/OS Connect exposes the CICS application programs/data through REST APIs
3. API Connect serves as a gateway to z/OS Connect, manages the z/OS Connect APIs and establishes a portal for developers to gain access to the APIs

## 1. Install z/OS Connect

- Please refer to the **Installation and Initial Setup** section of this [PDF](doc/source/zOSConnectEEV3GettingStarted.pdf) on how to install z/OS Connect. Go to page 8 for information on installation.

## 2. Create a z/OS Connect Project

- Open the Eclipse tool (IBMÂ® Explorer for z/OS Aqua) in which you installed the z/OS Connect EE API Editor.

- Switch to the z/OS Connect Enterprise Edition perspective.

  - From menu bar, select **Window > Open Perspective > Other**

  - In the list of perspectives, select **z/OS Connect Enterprise Edition** and click **OK**.

  You are now in the **z/OS Connect Enterprise Edition** perspective, with related views and resources readily available.

- Create an API project.

- From the menu bar, select **File > New > z/OS Connect EE API Project**. The z/OS Connect EE API Project wizard opens.

  - Enter the project properties below, then click **Finish**.

| **Project property** |                                                                           **Description**                                                                            |                 **Naming Convention**                  |

  |   HEARTRATE   |                                                Log of patient heart rate when measured at a doctor's visit                                                 |
  | BLOODPRESSURE |                                              Log of patient blood pressure when measured at a doctor's visit                                               |
  |    SESSION    |                                                  Log of brain activity measurements taken during analysis                                                  |
  | APPOINTMENTS  |                                  Record of appointments for each patient (including doctor's name, specialty and reason)                                   |
  |   ALLERGIES   |                                                   List of any allergies a patient has and when they were diagnosed                                                   |
  | OBSERVATIONS  | Log of patient measurements (such as height and weight), lab results (like cholesterol and blood sugar) and questionnaire answers (such as smoking status) |

- Seven (7) of the tables are used in the Web Interface:

  - PATIENT

  - USER

  - MEDICATION

  - PRESCRIPTION

  - APPOINTMENTS

  - ALLERGIES

  - OBSERVATIONS

- Create the tables for the functions that will be implemented in the Healthcare system.

  - The tables should be created in the table space that was defined to contain the Healthcare tables

  - Once the database and tables are created, a BIND needs to take place to connect the CICS application and the database.

- The commands for creating the database tables are listed in this [PDF](doc/source/CreateTableStatements.pdf)

## 4. Populate DB2 database with Synthea data

- Visit this [code pattern](https://developer.ibm.com/patterns/transform-load-big-data-csv-files-db2-zos-database/) for the instructions on populating your DB2 database with data from the Synthea tool

## 5. Expose DB2 data through z/OS Connect

- [Click this link to go to the steps for exposing DB2 data through z/OS Connect](ExposeDB2DataThroughzOSConnect.md)

## 6. Create CICS Application

- A sample CICS application is included in this code pattern. The application is known as HCAZ. It is a simple CICS application for inputting and retrieving healthcare information.

- The source code is included in the [HCAZ_Source](HCAZ_Source) folder.

- The source code includes JCL files to install the application. Some changes may need to be made to the JCL depending on your installation. If you have any questions ask your organization's z/OS System Programmer or a z/OS System Administrator.
